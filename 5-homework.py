# Problem 1: FizzBuzz
# Write a loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 20. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of 
# the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and 
# five print "FizzBuzz".
# Ask Gaurav if you don't know the "modulo" operator
# The first few lines should look like this:
#
# 1
# 2
# Fizz
# 4
# Buzz
# Fizz
# 7
# 8
# Fizz
# Buzz
# 11
# Fizz
# 13
# 14
# FizzBuzz
# 16


# Problem 2: Factorial
# Given some number n, print out n! (as in the product of all numbers from 1 to n)

n = 8
# start your implementation here and reference the above variable: n
# In this case, it should print 40320



# Problem 3: I took 10 samples of salaries from the EPID department. 
# What is the average salary overall? What is the average salary for 
# - Research Administrators
# - Professors
# - Professor Emeritus
# - Associate Professors
# Hint: We haven't talked about averages. How do you compute a mean?
